# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version


* User Stories


As a user, I want to GET and POST reviews about travel destinations.

As a user, I want to GET reviews by country or city.

As a user, I want to see the most popular travel destinations by number of reviews or by overall rating.

As a user, I want to PUT and DELETE reviews, but only if I wrote them. (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. You can always try authentication later.)

As a user, I want to look up random destinations just for fun.
